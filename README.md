# Knapsack-Problem
Iterative algorithm solution for the knapsack problem

The [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.


## Usage

```
Array = [1,22,333]
sortArray(Array)
```

to sort Array in time complexity O(kn) where k = number of digits in largest number.

## Examples

```
Array = [-470,1911,120,-314,-4,1871,1749,1588,195,1097]
print(sortArray(Array))
```

returns 
[-470, -314, -4, 120, 195, 1097, 1588, 1749, 1871, 191]

sorting the array digit-wise.
